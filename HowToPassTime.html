               <p> 
               A lot of people may be bored or confused with how they can use their time efficiently.
               Here are some useful ways you can spend your time to better help yourself in the end. 
               One thing you can learn is a language, that will always benefit you in the long run because it increases your knowledge.
               To add on to the learning aspect, you can always read up on something random to increase your overall knowledge. 
               Another thing that is obvious is to practice a passion or do something that entertains you like watch a movie or play a game.
