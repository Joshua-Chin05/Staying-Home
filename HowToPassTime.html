               <h2>Stress Reduction and me</h2>
               <p> 
               As an introvert, being stuck at home isnt too much of a problem,
                in fact, at times, I enjoy it. Like many others, 
                while being stuck at home, 
                I enjoy playing games, watching shows, and talking with friends.
                However I am excited for this to end, 
                as it means I am able to do a variety of extracirriculars that I enjoy doing ike sports and martial arts.
